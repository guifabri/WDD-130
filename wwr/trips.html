          <h1>5‚Äì6 Day Desolation Canyon</h1>
          <p>As one of the largest roadless areas in the contiguous US, Desolation Canyon is aptly named. Go where no
            road can take
            you as you float the Green River through this classic Eastern Utah canyon. This is one of our most popular
            rafting trips
            for families, and is a great introduction to whitewater rafting with consistent but mostly gentle rapids,
            and a handful
            of bigger ones just for fun. There are endless side canyons to explore on foot, and rich historic and
            prehistoric sites
            to visit. Take five or six days to feel the joy of reconnecting with the flow of nature.</p>

          <h1>2‚Äì3 Day Westwater</h1>
          <p>Westwater Canyon is the best Utah whitewater rafting trip for folks who are short on time but still want a
            taste of a
            wild river and canyon. Chose from two- or three-day trips and see bald eagles, red rock canyon walls, and
            the famous
            black rocks that give Westwater the nickname ‚ÄúThe Miniature Grand Canyon!" In just a couple days, get the
            best of both
            worlds: relaxing flat water followed by big, punchy rapids. This truly is the best bang for your buck!</p>

          <h1>4 Day Lodore Canyon</h1>
          <p>Lodore Canyon on the Green River in northeastern Utah is a trip full of iconic rapids and beautiful
            scenery. The trip
            begins at the ‚ÄúGates of Lodore,‚Äù where the river flows into an exquisite, 800-foot-deep, vermillion canyon.
            Hiking
            opportunities to waterfalls and ancient rock art sites abound, and there is ample time for relaxing on the
            shaded, sandy
            beach camps. This trip begins in Colorado and crosses into Utah, running through the heart of Dinosaur
            National
            Monument. This is one trip you have to see to believe it's real!</p>
